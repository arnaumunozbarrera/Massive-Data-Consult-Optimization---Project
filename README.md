# Massive Data  & Consult Optimization for an Oracle DB
### Autor:

## Introduction
In this practice we will work on the mass import of data in Oracle using Python, we will manage them and evaluate the impact of indexes on the execution of queries. 
For data import you will need to complete the notebook [insertData](src/insertData.ipynb). 
This repository contains datasets of different types and characteristics that are used to evaluate computational learning methods. For data management, 
the Python [script](src/testUCI.py) delivered with the practice will have to be adapted so that it is able to load the data set, 
perform the specified experiment and save the results obtained in the database. 

Finally, with the entire volume of data generated, the impact of the indexes on the queries to be made will be evaluated.

### Prerequisites
- Scripts Python: Code of this repository. 
- Example data of UCI: Iris, Ionosphere, Breast Cancer, Letter Recognition. Can get them through the python package of UIC (ucimlrepo).
- SQLDeveloper, VS Code (IDE to code using Python).
